# Skate4You
Graduation project Let's Skate

Skate 4 You is a game where you can learn how to skateboard!
For my thesis I build a prototype for Skate 4 You.
In this prototype the player will learn the Ollie, which is the first trick in skateboarding.


#Installation

Explanation DIY Let's Skate:

In addition to the Kinect 360 being a handy option for me, it is also easier to get my product working myself. If you want to use my app yourself at home, you need a number of things, these are:

A Kinect for the Xbox 360 and an Adapter
A Windows computer
The Kinect 360 SDK
My application

First, the SDK must be installed so that the computer can read the Kinect.
It can be downloaded here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278
After installing the SDK, you can connect the Kinect to the computer.
The Kinect can be connected by means of a USB port in the computer and a plug for the power supply.
After the Kinect has been connected, you can check if it works using the Kinect Developer Tool, which can be downloaded at the bottom of the SDK page.
When the camera is connected and working, my application can be started. Within my application it will be indicated whether the player has been detected.
The player can also be seen at the bottom right, so that you know how you stand in front of your camera.
Once these steps have been completed, my app can be used by anyone.
